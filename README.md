# Random-Inspirational-Quote-Generator

This is a funny project that randomly generates inspirational quotes from a few predetermined templates.
This app works by storing some predetermined templates with blank spaces to be filled in in a doubly 
linked list and the user can choose whichever one they want. After hitting a generate button, the blank 
spaces are filled with random words from a large, predetermined list of words that would work in 
the context (ex: noun, verb, adjective, etc.). Then hilarity ensues, or maybe it ends up being deep.

Who knows?
